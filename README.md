A powerful, schema-aware API filtering engine for Laravel. It handles complex query parameters (filtering, sorting, field selection, relationship loading, and pagination) using native Laravel validation and highly optimized, database-agnostic Eloquent queries.

## Why Use It?

When building modern APIs, developers often face a difficult choice: write dozens of custom endpoints for every specific search context (manually validating and mapping queries for each one), or abandon REST entirely for heavy data-graph abstractions like GraphQL. 

This package gives you the power of dynamic querying while keeping your application native and RESTful. By empowering your standard Laravel `index` endpoints, you can:
- **Avoid Endpoint Sprawl:** You no longer need to write custom search endpoints (e.g., `/users/active`, `/users/recent`). A single endpoint safely handles infinitely complex combinations of filters, sorts, and includes.
- **Stay Strictly RESTful:** Keep your architecture native to Laravel without introducing the massive overhead, caching complexities, and learning curves associated with GraphQL.
- **Zero-Boilerplate Security:** It acts as a **Schema-Aware Translation Layer**. It automatically inspects your Eloquent model schema to whitelist columns, generate strict validation rules, and securely cast URL values into native PHP types before they ever hit the database.

## Features

- **Schema-Aware Validation:** Validation rules and type casting are automatically generated from your Eloquent model schema.
- **High Performance Caching:** Automatically caches generated rules to prevent schema introspection overhead in production.
- **Global Security Layer:** Granularly enable or disable specific URL features (like filtering, sorting, or includes) globally via the configuration file.
- **AI Agent Ready:** Ships with a built-in Laravel Boost Skill to instantly teach AI coding assistants how to use the package in your project.
- **API Documentation Ready:** Exposes methods to retrieve deduplicated filter schemas, making it incredibly easy to auto-generate OpenAPI/Swagger specs or dynamic frontend UIs.
- **Database Agnostic:** Natively supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server out of the box via standard Eloquent methods.
- **Two Syntax Formats:** Support for both standard Laravel Arrays and raw JSON strings in the URL.
- **Strict Visibility:** Fully respects `$visible` and `$hidden` arrays on your models to prevent data exposure.
- **IDE Autocompletion:** Plug-and-play autocomplete for all macros out of the box.

## Installation

1. Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require victormgomes/query-params
```

2. Publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="query-params-config"
```

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Auto-generate validation rules

Annotate your FormRequest with `#[MapQueryParams(Model::class)]`.

```php
// app/Http/Requests/IndexUserRequest.php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest;
use Victormgomes\QueryParams\Attributes\MapQueryParams;
use App\Models\User;

#[MapQueryParams(User::class)]
class IndexUserRequest extends FormRequest
{
    public function authorize(): bool
    {
        return true;
    }
}
```

It generates the validation rules based on the model schema.

### Step 2: Build the query

The package automatically adds powerful new methods directly to all your Eloquent models. You can call these anywhere in your application (such as a Controller or a Service class) by simply passing the validated request:

```php
// app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php
use App\Models\User;
use App\Http\Requests\IndexUserRequest;
use Illuminate\Pagination\LengthAwarePaginator;

public function index(IndexUserRequest $request): LengthAwarePaginator
{
    // Pass the request to automatically apply all URL parameters
    return User::paginateQuery($request);
}
```

This returns a `LengthAwarePaginator` with all valid filters, sorts, includes, and pagination automatically applied.

---

## Available Model Methods

All Eloquent models are automatically equipped with the following methods out of the box:

```php
// Full pipeline: returns a paginated result
User::paginateQuery(?Request $request = null): LengthAwarePaginator

// Full pipeline: returns a cursor-paginated result (for massive datasets)
User::cursorPaginateQuery(?Request $request = null): CursorPaginator

// Raw builder: chain additional constraints before pagination
User::buildQuery(?Request $request = null): Eloquent\Builder

// Retrieve the auto-generated validation rules
User::getQueryRules(): array

// Retrieve a deduplicated schema representing allowed filters and includes for frontends
User::getFilterSchema(): array
```
